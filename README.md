# UNOphLib
Library for working with PH on the Arduino UNO. 
Created for working with the H-101 PH probe and Gravity PH Meter V2.0. 

Variables it takes as input: 

Where you want to store calibration voltages in the EEPROM. What the PHs are for these corresponding voltages. 
Which anaologue pin is reading the PH board. 

From these it is able to calibrate factors and calculate PH.
